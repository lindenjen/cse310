| 9/23/24 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | Met with my teammates to discuss the plan for Sprint 1. We came up with the idea of a pie chart agenda app that we will make using Dart and Flutter.                                                                                                                                                                         |      60       |
| 9/23/24 | 6:00 pm    |    IM    | Started to set up my Java environment with trying to mess around with a Java SDK on VS code before getting frustrated and deciding to work with Intellij IDEA for my Java module instead, which I installed and completed a 'Hello World'.                                                                                   |      90       |
| 9/24/24 | 8:30 pm    |    IM    | I filled out the readme for my Java program and I also started brainstorming about how to execute the logic I will need for my program. I wrote down a couple ideas in my notes to research and learn how to do in Java.                                                                                                     |      90       |
| 9/25/24 | 2:00 pm    |    TP    | Spent the class working with my teammates on the readme file for our Github Project. We decided to use Dart and JSON files. We also set roles for this sprint on the readme.                                                                                                                                                 |      60       |
| 9/26/24 | 7:20 pm    |    IM    | Started to learn Java and experiment with loops and declaring classes. I also started making my program by setting the bare bones of a couple various classes and starting the briefcase logic.                                                                                                                              |      90       |
| 9/27/24 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | Brother Macbeth was out sick so I discussed my progress with the module with my roommate instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |      60       |
| 9/28/24 | 1:30 pm    |    IM    | I spent a bit of time creating a couple different files under my main folder for different classes and methods. I also continued on trying to build the briefcase logic, I had to go between my code and Java tutorials to help me figure out my next steps.                                                                 |      40       |
| 9/30/24 | 2:00 pm    |    TP    | Spent the class working with my teammates to plan out our Android App Framework. We committed to using Dart and Flutter so we all started the process of figuring out how to download a Flutter SDK.                                                                                                                         |      60       |
| 10/1/24 | 5:20 pm    |    TP    | I installed Android Studio to start working with Flutter but it took me a while to get it fully set up, especially with Dart and Flutter. I had to make sure the SDK was in the right folder and install Dart plug-ins.                                                                                                      |      60       |
| 10/2/24 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | Team review meetings in class, my team and I presented our pie schedule app idea to the class and to Brother Macbeth.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |      60       |
| 10/2/24 | 6:30 pm    |    IM    | Started following the Java tutorial on Code Academy to learn about variable types such as Strings and Ints and variable logic such as addition and multiplication.                                                                                                                                                           |      60       |
| 10/2/24 | 10:30 pm   |    IM    | Continued following the Java tutorial on Code Academy. I learnt about conditionals and arrays, I practiced making my own arrays in the Code Academy IDE.                                                                                                                                                                     |      60       |
| 10/3/24 | 8:20 pm    |    IM    | I really started to flesh out the logic of my Deal or No Deal program. I created boxes that would print to the console to look like the briefcases shown on the show, I also created variables for open and unopened so that the user can only see the value of the cases they chose. I finished the first loop of the game. |      120      |
| 10/4/24 | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | Brother Macbeth was out sick so I shared my working program with my roommate and let her play a round of the game. I also showed her some of my code to explain how I created the program.                                                                                                                                   |      60       |
| 10/4/24 | 11:00 pm   |    IM    | Cleaned up my code and read through it, made sure there wasn't any bad syntax or errors that I had forgotten about. I also made sure to leave good comments throughout the code so that it's apparent what the code is doing throughout the program.                                                                         |      60       |
| 10/5/24 | 5:00 pm    |    TP    | Spent time going over the official Dart language documentation in order to prepare myself for the next Sprint. I also performed a 'Hello World' using Dart in my Android Studio App.                                                                                                                                         |      60       |
