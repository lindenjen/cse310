## Overview

**Project Title**: Creating Deal or No Deal with Java

**Project Description**: I will be learning and using Java in order to create a program that mimics the popular game show, Deal or No Deal.

**Project Goals**: My project goals are to create a program with Java that demonstrates the use of conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and a data structure.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. The first step to building this program is learning how conditionals, loops, classes, etc. work in Java. Before I can attempt to build the logic required for this program I will need to learn how to declare variables and how Java syntax works.
2. The second step to building this program is taking the skills I learnt and combining them in order to create a fully functional guessing game.
3. The last step to building this program is testing it for any bugs and correcting any possibly syntax errors. 

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the DealOrNoDeal program in an IDE and play the round of Deal or No Deal.
2. Enter a number between 1-26 to choose your briefcase, and then choose 6 other briefcases to eliminate.
3. The banker will then offer you an amount of money to walk away, and you choose 'Deal or No Deal'.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Intellij IDEA
*
*

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Code Academy Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
* [Loops in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loops-in-java/)
* [Arrays in Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-java/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I want to create a bigger loop so that the game will run for more than just one round. I will also have to create new methods so that the program keeps track of the briefcases that the player has already chosen.
* [ ] Creating a way for cuter text output of the briefcases would be fun idea, replacing the brackets with an animation or picture instead.
* [ ] I want to update the program so when the user chooses one of the six briefcases to be eliminated, the display will change to represent the chosen briefcases.
